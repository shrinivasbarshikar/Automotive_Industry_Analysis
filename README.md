# Automotive Industry Analysis Dashboard
## Overview
This project involves cleaning, transforming, and visualizing automotive industry data using Power BI. The main objective is to build an interactive dashboard that provides insights into key metrics and performance indicators within the automotive industry. By employing a Snowflake schema for data modeling, this project integrates multiple data sources into a single, user-friendly dashboard.

## Key Features
Data Cleaning & Transformation: The data has been thoroughly cleaned and transformed to ensure consistency and accuracy.
Snowflake Schema: Utilized a Snowflake schema to structure and organize the data for efficient querying and analysis.
Interactive Dashboard: The dashboard allows users to filter and drill down into key data points, providing insights into various aspects of the automotive industry, including sales, production, and market trends.
Power BI: The data model and visuals were created using Power BI to deliver interactive and dynamic reports.
Tools and Technologies Used
Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
Snowflake Schema: For structuring the data model.
DAX: For calculated fields and measures in Power BI.
Power Query: For data transformation and cleaning.
Data Sources
Automotive sales data (Region, Make, Model, etc.)
Production and inventory data
Market trends data
Customer feedback and surveys (optional)
Each of these data sources has been integrated into the Power BI project using the Snowflake schema to maintain clarity and ensure accurate reporting.

Data Model
The data is structured using a Snowflake schema, which ensures normalization of data across several related tables. The tables used in the schema are:

Dashboard Components
Sales Analysis: Visualize key sales metrics such as units sold, sales revenue, and sales trends over time.
Production Overview: Track production metrics, including production volumes, factory performance, and operational costs.
Market Insights: Visualize market growth, customer preferences, and industry trends across various regions.

## Steps Involved
1. Data Collection
Gathered automotive industry data from various sources such as sales, production, and market trend datasets.
2. Data Cleaning
Used Power Query in Power BI to clean the data, including handling missing values, duplicates, and formatting issues.
3. Data Transformation
Transformed the data into the appropriate format for analysis, including calculating key metrics and adding calculated columns using DAX.
4. Modeling the Data (Snowflake Schema)
Designed and implemented a Snowflake schema with a focus on reducing redundancy and improving data integrity.
5. Creating Visualizations
Built various interactive visuals, including bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, and KPI indicators to represent the data effectively.
6. Building the Dashboard
Combined all visualizations into a single interactive Power BI dashboard, allowing users to filter data by region, time period, car model, and other factors.
7. Optimization & Testing
Ensured the dashboard performs optimally, with fast loading times and accurate data, by optimizing queries and DAX measures.
8. Deployment
Published the Power BI report for internal or external use, making it accessible via the Power BI service.
How to Use
Interactive Filters: Use the slicers on the dashboard to filter data by regions, time periods, car models, and other attributes.
Drill-through Functionality: Right-click on certain visuals to drill deeper into the underlying data for more detailed analysis.
Hover Tooltips: Hover over any data point to view additional information and insights related to that point.
KPI Metrics: The dashboard includes key performance indicators that highlight sales growth, production efficiency, and other important metrics.
Future Enhancements
Integration of real-time data feeds for up-to-date analysis.
Advanced predictive analytics for forecasting trends in sales and production.
Expansion of the dataset to include customer demographic data
